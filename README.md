# Data table with React js, EventSource, Jasmine testing

It's an SPA which reads measurements from stream (EventSource). The changes are reflected in the table as soon as they are updated. Connection starts automatically - use start/stop buttons to control the process.



Open public/index.html to see the result data table. <a target="_blank" href="https://shorinamaria.github.io/ReactDataTable/public/index.html">Here</a>
